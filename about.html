      <p>
        Sweet Rise Bakery was founded in 2025 with one simple mission: to share the warmth of freshly baked goods with
        our community.
        We believe that bread, pastries, and cakes are more than food â€” they are moments of comfort, celebration, and
        joy.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our bakers start early every morning to craft everything from scratch, using only the freshest ingredients.
        From crusty sourdough loaves to buttery croissants and indulgent cakes, every bite tells a story of care and
        passion.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a startup bakery, we are proud to support local farmers and suppliers, keeping our ingredients natural and
        sustainable.
        At Sweet Rise, community comes first, and every customer is family.
